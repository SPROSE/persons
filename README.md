Take a look at the following API: 

https://services.odata.org/Experimental/OData/OData.svc/

This lists a few endpoints that return some data. The data, in a standard JSON format, is defined by the OData document if you need it:

https://services.odata.org/Experimental/OData/OData.svc/$metadata

Could you provide a React application that reads the list of 'Persons' and displays them with the 'PersonDetails' for each. There is a photo stream for the PersonDetails, but you can ignore that. This is really about how you structure and get the React application to work. I would think it would take no more than a couple of hours. The end points are:

https://services.odata.org/Experimental/OData/OData.svc/Persons
https://services.odata.org/Experimental/OData/OData.svc/PersonDetails

Assuming you can do that could you put your resulting app in one of the git services on the web and let us have a look at the code? I hope that seems reasonable, but if you have any concerns about it then please do let me know.
